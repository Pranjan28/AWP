                        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                            lightweight
                            language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
                            connected to the
                            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

                        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core
                            set of
                            language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                            be
                            extended
                            for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

                       
                        
                        </artice>
